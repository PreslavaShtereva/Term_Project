# Term_Project
The program divides the average of all elements of an array by 2 until the average of the array values falls below a specified parameter. 

  -The loop keeps dividing all the elements in the array by 2, as long as the average of the elements is greater than or equal to the parameter
  
  -The stopping condition is when the average of the elements falls below the parameter. At that point, the loop stops dividing the array further.
